          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
          <p>Hello brothers and sisters. I’m honored to be here representing Midwest Bible College—where I was ordained and now serve as chairman of the board. MBC is a unique Bible college. We don’t teach man-made doctrines; we teach the pure, unchanging Word of God. Our mission is to prepare men and women from all walks of life—young and old, every race and background—for ministry in local churches, communities, and the world. Last year alone, MBC trained students from 45 different churches, and through our African affiliate school in Uganda, we have trained pastors and leaders across eight nations. God is expanding His Kingdom through faithful servants who have been equipped with His Word. I want to begin today by sharing a personal testimony inspired by Psalm 40:1-4—a testimony of God’s faithfulness to deliver, restore, and lead us in newness of life.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Call to Holiness</h4>
          <p>The foundation of our walk with God is holiness. The Bible is clear: “Be holy, because I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). This isn’t optional. It’s a command. Look at Leviticus 11:44-45:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I am the Lord your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature... I brought you out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy.” (Leviticus 11:44-45)</p>
          <p>To consecrate means to set apart—to be pure, innocent, free from all impurities. God brought Israel out of slavery in Egypt—not just to free them physically but to call them into a holy relationship with Him. Likewise, He delivered us from sin’s bondage by the precious blood of Jesus. Romans 6:16-18 reminds us: when we obey sin, we are slaves to death; but when we obey Jesus, we become slaves to righteousness. We’ve been bought with a price—the blood of Christ—and now we must live clean and holy lives.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Do We Truly Walk in Holiness?</h4>
          <p>The question I want to ask you today is this: Do we walk in holiness? Or do we still stumble in sin, caught in cycles of guilt and shame?</p>
          <p>It’s easy to feel defeated. So many believers struggle with this. But remember Jesus’ teaching about forgiveness: forgive seventy times seven. God’s mercy is overwhelming—He wants us to stop focusing on sin and start focusing on His grace.</p>
          <p>Ephesians 4:22-24 gives us the blueprint:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Put off your old self, which belongs to your former way of life and is corrupted by deceitful desires; be renewed in the spirit of your minds; and put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.” (Ephesians 4:22-24)</p>
          <p>We must shed the old—pride, greed, jealousy, anger, immorality—and put on the new nature, reflecting God’s holiness.</p>
          <p>Romans 12:1-2 tells us to offer our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. That means our entire lives—thoughts, actions, and attitudes—must honor Him.</p>
          <p>1 Peter 2:11-12 warns us that sinful desires wage war against our souls, but we are called to live good lives and do good deeds so that even those outside the faith may glorify God.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Challenge of Our Times</h4>
          <p>We live in a world that is growing darker. Hard hearts ignore God’s call to holiness. Our society struggles with rebellion, greed, injustice, division, and many social ills—from unrest to moral decay.</p>
          <p>But as believers, we are called to stand apart. We must walk in holiness, righteousness, and love. We must speak truth in a world that desperately needs it.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Conclusion</h4>
          <p>God has set us apart to be holy as He is holy. He delivered us from bondage to sin so that we might walk in newness of life. It is not enough to be forgiven; we must live out our calling.</p>
          <p>Let us commit today to walking in holiness—not by our own power, but by the grace and strength of Jesus Christ. Let us put off the old self and put on the new self, renewed in spirit and transformed by His Word.</p> 
          <p>May our lives shine as beacons of righteousness and love in this dark world.</p>
