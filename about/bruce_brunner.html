        </div>

            <p class="text-left">Bruce Brunner was born on January 28, 1951, in Jackson Heights, New York. He graduated from Berner High School in Massapequa Park, New York in 1969 and went on to attend Wagner College in Staten Island, New York.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In 1994, Bruce was hired by Visual Image Photography, Cedarburg, Wisconsin as Sales Manager. Through Bruce’s sales and managerial efforts, Visual Image Photography became a dominant player in the school picture and sports photography marketplace. Now semi-retired, Bruce works part-time as the shipping coordinator for Visual Image Photography, Cedarburg, Wisconsin where he brings reliability and care to every task. His professional journey has been marked by dedication, consistency, and a strong work ethic—values that have carried through every stage of his life.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Bruce has been happily married to his wonderful wife Kim since 1977. Together, they’ve built a loving family that includes three sons and four cherished grandchildren, all who are walking with the Lord, and some involved in the ministry. Family is at the heart of Bruce’s life, and he considers himself truly blessed.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Bruce has been a devoted believer in Jesus Christ since 1980-a journey that began thanks to the loving influence of his wife, Kim. Together, they led a weekly Bible study in their home for over 21 years, opening their doors and hearts to others seeking a deeper relationship with God.</p>
            <p class="text-left">He remains active in ministry through his involvement with Faith Walkers Ministry, where he shares the gospel with men of all ages, and with Intercessors for America, where he serves as an intercessor for the nation, the State of Wisconsin, its leaders, and current affairs. Bruce is also an engaged member of Eastbrook Church, serving faithfully as a Prayer Team Minister, supporting others through intercessory prayer and encouragement.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In his free time, Bruce enjoys the quiet joys of fishing and the satisfying challenge of puzzling—two pastimes that reflect his appreciation for patience, focus, and peaceful moments.</p>
